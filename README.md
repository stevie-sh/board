# Goals:
- put something to display on website that utilizes a redux component and displays a grid or a square-like figure to explore path finding algorithms and maze-solvers
- entry to A* and other path-finders

- get used to webstorm
- learn more redux-specific things
- get in the process of posting nanoapps onto blog

- hope to make it possible to have a webserver to give instructions to pathfinder.

## PathFinders or Similar Things to Visualize

- Flood Fill Variant?
- Perhaps some Union-Find variant.

## TODO (not ordered):
- get react to be publicly accessible on clientside (DONE)
